The Task involves migrating a growing NodeJS application, "node-hostname," from a single server setup to a cloud-native architecture due to performance and downtime issues.

The goal is to enhance reliability, scalability, and deployment efficiency.

To achieve this using AWS services:

AWS Account Creation: Create an AWS account to leverage its cloud services.


Containerization with Docker: Containerize the NodeJS application using Docker, ensuring a portable and scalable deployment.


Image Storage on Amazon ECR: Push the Docker container image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for secure and scalable storage.


Deployment with Amazon EKS: Run the application on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to orchestrate and manage containers efficiently.


HTTPS Exposure: Implement HTTPS exposure for the application to ensure secure communication.


This migration aims to address performance bottlenecks, downtime issues, and slow deployment, providing a more robust, scalable, and efficient cloud-based infrastructure using AWS services.
